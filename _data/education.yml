  summary: |
          As part of this thesis, the models U-Net2D, U-Net3D, and Vision Transformer were trained using remote sensing
          data with the aim of predicting the final burned area from wildfires. The models were implemented using
          the PyTorch framework in a Python environment. The dataset included meteorological variables, NDVI and
          LAI indices, previously burned areas, comprising a total of 28 variables. The models were trained and making
          predictions using data from 5 days before and 5 days after the fire events, given a iginition point. Additionally,
          data were collected to analyze how forest fires spread and which variables contribute to their propagation, using
          Explainable AI techniques. Both the data and the developed models are open source and available on <br>
