      As part of this thesis, the models U-Net2D, U-Net3D, and Vision Transformer were trained using remote sensing
      data with the aim of predicting the final burned area from wildfires. The models were implemented using
      the PyTorch framework in a Python environment. The dataset included meteorological variables, NDVI and
      LAI indices, previously burned areas, comprising a total of 28 variables. The models were trained and making
      predictions using data from 5 days before and 5 days after the fire events, given an ignition point. Additionally,
      data were collected to analyze how forest fires spread and which variables contribute to their propagation, using
      Explainable AI techniques. Thesis PDF, Slides, data and the developed models are open source and available on: <br>
