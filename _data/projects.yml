- project: Burned Area mapping from Sentinel-2 Images 
  role: ""
  duration: ""

            <div style="text-align: justify;">
            Developed in Python using frameworks Xarray, GeoPandas, odc, Rasterio, Shapely, etc., which, by providing an
            area with 4 coordinates and the start date of a wildfire, performs fully automated mapping using Sentinel-2
            data. The output includes a tiff file with the DNBR index, a shapefile with the wildfire polygon (geometrically
            corrected), and a shapefile with the classification of the burned area into 4 categories. Detailed information is
            available on GitHub

            <div style="text-align: justify;">
            Developed in Python, which, by providing a shapefile of the burned area polygon and shapefiles such as NATURA2000,
            Corine Land Cover, etc., calculates the percentage of each category within the wildfire polygon. In other words,
            it calculates what percentage of a burned area is NATURA2000 or any other category. Detailed information is
            available on GitHub
