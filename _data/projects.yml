            Developed in Python using frameworks Xarray, GeoPandas, odc, Rasterio, Shapely, etc., which, by providing an
            area with 4 coordinates and the start date of a wildfire, performs fully automated mapping using Sentinel-2
            data. The output includes a tiff file with the DNBR index, a shapefile with the wildfire polygon (geometrically
            corrected), and a shapefile with the classification of the burned area into 4 categories. Detailed information is
            available on GitHub
