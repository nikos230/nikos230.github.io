      As part of this thesis, the models U-Net2D, U-Net3D, and
      Vision Transformer were trained using remote sensing data with the aim of
      predicting the final burned area from wildfires. The models were implemented using the
      PyTorch framework in a Python environment.

      The dataset included meteorological variables, NDVI and LAI
      indices, and previously burned areas, comprising a total of 28 variables.
      The models were trained and produced predictions using data from
      5 days before and 5 days after fire events, given an ignition point.

      Additionally, data were collected to analyze wildfire propagation and identify contributing
      factors using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.
