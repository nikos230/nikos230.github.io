                      <p>
                        I received my diploma in Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens in 2025.
                        My diploma thesis focused on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for wildfire spread prediction using remote sensing data.
                        I completed a three-month internship at the National Observatory of Athens, focusing on Earth observation and wildfire mapping. 
                        I am currently working at the Athena Research Center, where I am involved in training foundation models for fire detection from satellite data. 
                        My primary research interests include remote sensing and deep learning, with an emphasis on wildfire-related applications.
                      </p>
